# SG Mobile Plans Comparison

Live demo: https://telco-comparison.web.app/

This project, built on ReactJS, Redux, and Google Firebase, allows users to compare mobile plans in Singapore. Users are able to enter their desired Data, Talktime, and SMS requirements, and the website will filter out the most relevant plans for them.

This project is also fully responsive, allowing users to search and compare their mobile plans conveniently regardless of the device they are accessing the website from.

There are 2 main features in this website:
